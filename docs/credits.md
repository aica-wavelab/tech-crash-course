# Generalist tool for ML

[Marcelle](https://marcelle.dev/){: .btn .fs-5 .mb-4 .mb-md-0 .mr-2 target="_blank"}

Marcelle is a modular open source toolkit for programming interactive machine learning applications. Marcelle is built around components embedding computation and interaction that can be composed to form reactive machine learning pipelines and custom user interfaces. This architecture enables rapid prototyping and extension. Marcelle can be used to build interfaces to Python scripts, and it provides flexible data stores to facilitate collaboration between machine learning experts, designers and end users.

[Wekinator](http://www.wekinator.org/){: .btn .fs-5 .mb-4 .mb-md-0 .mr-2 target="_blank"}

The Wekinator is free, open source software that allows anyone to use machine learning to build new musical instruments, gestural game controllers, computer vision or computer listening systems, and more. The Wekinator allows users to build new interactive systems by demonstrating human actions and computer responses, instead of writing programming code.

[ml-lib](https://github.com/irllabs/ml-lib){: .btn .fs-5 .mb-4 .mb-md-0 .mr-2 target="_blank"}

ml-lib is a library of machine learning externals for Max and Pure Data. ml-lib is primarily based on the Gesture Recognition Toolkit by Nick Gillian ml-lib is designed to work on a variety of platforms including OS X, Windows, Linux, on Intel and ARM architectures.
The goal of ml-lib is to provide a simple, consistent interface to a wide range of machine learning techniques in Max and Pure Data.

[nn~](https://github.com/acids-ircam/nn_tilde){: .btn .fs-5 .mb-4 .mb-md-0 .mr-2 target="_blank"}

nn~ is a Pd or Max/MSP external object that allows to load and run neural networks in real-time. It is based on the PyTorch C++ API and can load any network that can be exported from PyTorch to TorchScript. It can be used to load RAVE models.

[RAVE](https://github.com/acids-ircam/RAVE){: .btn .fs-5 .mb-4 .mb-md-0 .mr-2 target="_blank"}

Rave is a variational autoencoder for fast and high-quality neural audio synthesis developed by Antoine Caillon and Philippe Esling from IRCAM.

[LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction){: .btn .fs-5 .mb-4 .mb-md-0 .mr-2 target="_blank"}

LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It enables applications that: 

- Are context-aware: connect a language model to sources of context (prompt instructions, few shot examples, content to ground its response in, etc.) 

- Reason: rely on a language model to reason (about how to answer based on provided context, what actions to take, etc.)

[Flucoma](https://learn.flucoma.org/){: .btn .fs-5 .mb-4 .mb-md-0 .mr-2 target="_blank"}

Combination of digital signal processing and machine learning. Connection to SuperCollider, PureData and Max. 


# Generalist tools for audio and visual programming

[Pure Data](https://puredata.info/){: .btn .fs-5 .mb-4 .mb-md-0 .mr-2 target="_blank"}

Pure Data (or just "Pd") is an open source visual programming language for multimedia. Pure Data allows you to create and manipulate audio systems using visual elements, rather than writing code. Think of it as building with virtual blocks – simply connect them together to design your unique audio setups.

[Plug Data](https://plugdata.org/){: .btn .fs-5 .mb-4 .mb-md-0 .mr-2 target="_blank"}

plugdata is a free/open-source visual programming environment based on pure-data. It is available for a wide range of operating systems, and can be used both as a standalone app, or as a VST3, LV2, CLAP or AU plugin. 
We recommend using Plug Data rather than Pure Data, as it provides a more user-friendly interface.

[SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/){: .btn .fs-5 .mb-4 .mb-md-0 .mr-2 target="_blank"}

SuperCollider is a platform for audio synthesis and algorithmic composition, used by musicians, artists, and researchers working with sound. It is free and open source software available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
