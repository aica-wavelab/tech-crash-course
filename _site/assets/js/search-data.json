    "content": "Have you ever trained a machine learning model ? If not, this is the right place to start. First of all, what is a machine learning? . Definition . Machine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can effectively generalize from examples and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions. In other words, machine learning (ML) part of the field of AI but its specificity lies in the fact that algorithms are learning from data. To give you a concrete example, let’s train your first image classifier from images collected with your webcam and using the application below. Train my first image classifier! . In this application, you can activate the webcam of your laptop on the left side of the screen. Below the webcam, you can choose a label to be associated with the images you will collect. Once the label selected, click on the button hold to collect to collect images with the corresponding label. Doing so, you will see the images you collect appearing in the Training set in the middle of the screen. Reiterate this process for each label you want to collect images for. Once you finalized the creation of your Training set (images + corresponding labels), you can click on the button Train to train your image classifier. Then, you can activate the webcam again and see the predictions of your image classifier in real-time in the component Prediction confidence on the bottom of the screen. Hints . Take the time to test the model you trained. Try to trick its predictions and see how it reacts. What data could you add to the training set to improve its predictions? . You trained your first image classifier! Congratulations! But you don’t know much about how machine learning works… Let’s now see what’s going on under the hood of this web application. ",

    "title": "The development cycle of ML",
    "content": "The development of ML is a cycle composed of 4 main steps. These steps are illustrated in the application below. The development cycle of ML . Data collection . The first step of the development cycle of ML is data collection. It consists in collecting and annotating data samples that can be used by an ML algorithm to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs. In the previous example, the data samples are images collected with your webcam and the corresponding labels you provided. If pairs of input and output are provided in the training set, we talk about supervised learning. If only inputs are provided, we talk about unsupervised learning. The data samples are usually gathered in two sets: the training set and the test set. The training set is used to train the ML model, while the test set is used to evaluate the performance of the trained model. In other words, the training set is the exemples you work on during the semester, while the test set is the final exam. We provide various miniature image datasets that represent classification problems in engineering, medecine, and public health: . | miniMASK: a dataset of 3 classes of images (with masks, without masks, and with masks incorrectly worn); | miniROAD: a dataset of 3 classes or green, orange, and red traffic lights; | miniTRASH: a dataset of 3 classes of images (packaging, transparent glass, and opaque glass); | miniRETINA: a medical dataset of 3 classes of retinoscopic images (healthy, macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy); | miniSKIN: a medical dataset of 2 classes of dermatoscopic images (benign and malignant skin lesions); | . On the Data collection page, click on one button to select the dataset you want to work with for the rest of the tutorial. Hints . Take the time observe each images (by clicking on the thumbnails). Are the differences between each classes obvious to you? . Training . The training phase comprises three steps: . 2.1. Features selection : in our case, we will use a pre-trained neural network called MobileNet that extract 1024 features from images. These features were learned from a large dataset of images (ImageNet) and can be used to represent any image. 2.2. Model selection : Many machine learning models exist and were developed. In our case, we will use a model called multi-layer perceptron (MLP). It is a simple artificial neural network composed of an input layer (in our case, the 1024 features from MobileNe, some hidden layers that we can choose, and an output layer (the number of classes). Two other parameters are important to set. The batchSize and the number of epochs. An artificial neural network can updates its neurons using several examples at the same time. The batch size indicates the number of images that will be used at each round to update the neurons. The number of epochs indicates the number of times the whole training set will be used to update the neurons. The higher the number of epochs, the more the model will be trained. However, if the number of epochs is too high, the model might overfit the training set and will not be able to generalize to new data. You can choose the number of hidden layers and neurons per layer, the batch size, and the number of epochs on the Training page of the application. 2.3. Training : Click on the training button to start the neural network optimization. You will then see two different learning curves appearing. The represent the losses and accuracies as a function of the number of epochs. The loss is a measure of the error between the predictions of the model and the true labels. The accuracy is the percentage of correct predictions. A validation loss and accuracy are computed using a portion of the training set that is not used for the training. If the validation loss and validation accuracy are not improving, it means that the model is overfitting the training set and that it will not generalize well to new data. In this case, you should stop the training and reflect on the parameters of the model or the data used for the task. Testing . At this point, the model only saw the training set, eventhough it artificially splited this set into a training and validation set. To really assess the model performance, we need to compute a test accuracy on unseen images. On the Testing page of the application, you can see two confusion matrices. On the left is shown the global accuracy and a confusion matrix computed on the training set only. The rows of the confusion matrix represent the true labels (what should be predicted), while the columns represent the predicted labels. The diagonal of the matrix represents the number of correct predictions. A confusion matrix gives a finer view of which class is confused with which class. On the left, you can see the global accuracy and a confusion matrix computed on the test set only. The test accuracy is a better indicator of the model performance. If the test accuracy is much lower than the training accuracy, it means that the model is overfitting the training set and that it will not generalize well to new data. Questions . | For the task you selected, what averaged accuracy would you obtain with a random classifer? Is the trained classifier better than a random classifier in your case? | What difference do you observe between the training and test accuracies? What does it mean? | Which classes are the most confused? Why do you think so? Among the confusions you identified, is there any would be more problematic than others in the problem selected? | What would you do to improve the model performance? | . Deployment . Now you trained and test a machine learning model, you can learn more about its behavior by observing its predictions on particular images. On the Deployment page of the application, you can see the predictions of the model when you click on the thumbnails of the training or test set. Machine learning models can be noisy and biased. Noisiness indicates that the model is not stable and that it can give different predictions for similar inputs (it’s unpredictably wrong). Bias indicates that the model is wrong or unfair for similar inputs (it’s always wrong in the same way). Biases in ML models can lead to discrimination as illustrated in many different controversies over the past years. These incidents are documented on a public website called AI incident database. Questions . Among erroneous predictions, can you identify biases? Are these biases explained by the training data? Are these biases problematic in the problem selected? . Now you know the elementary steps to train and test a machine learning model, you can try the same process on another dataset. The next section will teach you how to conduct the same steps using a programming langage (Python) and dedicated ML libraries. ",

    "content": "A computer program is a sequence instructions for a computer to execute. Programs often take inputs, process them, and produce outputs. The way inputs are processed are usually explicited by the human programmer, using a programming language. Machine learning (ML) offers an alternative to explicit programmation: ML algorithms can learn to process data from examples. The human developper provides pairs of input and its corresponding output, and the ML model is then optimized to reproduce the mapping from the example provided. We call this approach mapping by demonstration, and finds many applications in the creative and cultural industries: in performing arts (gesture to sound), in video games, in robotics, among others.

    "title": "Use your phone as a sensor device",
    "content": "Smartphones are excellent sensor devices because they include a large array of built-in sensors. For motion, they are equipped with accelerometers, gyroscopes, and step detection sensors. For geolocalisation, they are equipped with geopositioning, magnetic field detection, and light sensors. For touch detection, most touch screen enable precise multi-finger detection. Additionally, smartphones are widely accessible and come with the advantage of wireless connectivity, allowing for seamless data transmission without the need for physical cables. Their portability ensures they can be used in various settings, especially in performance-based contexts where mobility is essential. Moreover, smartphones have significant computing power, enabling them to not only collect but also process complex data in real-time. Open Sound Control (OSC) serves as an effective way to stream this sensor data. OSC is a communication protocol initially designed for networking sound synthesizers, computers, and other multimedia devices, offering more flexibility and a higher level of organization than traditional MIDI protocols. OSC signals can carry a variety of data types and are sent over standard network protocols like UDP or TCP. This compatibility with modern networking technologies makes OSC an ideal choice for transmitting the rich sensor data collected by smartphones. In creative and technical applications, OSC allows for this data to be streamed in real-time, enabling dynamic and interactive experiences. An Open Sound Control (OSC) message is structured to include an address pattern followed by typed arguments. Here’s a simple example of an OSC message: . | Address Pattern: /filter/frequency | Arguments: 440.0 | . In this example, /filter/frequency is the address pattern that indicates where the message is destined within the OSC namespace. It’s akin to a URL path in web development, pointing to a specific function or parameter in the receiving device or software. The argument 440.0 is the value that is being sent to the specified address. In this context, it could represent a frequency value in Hertz that is being sent to a sound synthesizer’s filter frequency parameter. The OSC message is compact and efficient, capable of supporting multiple arguments of different types (like integers, floats, strings, etc.) following the address pattern. Send OSC messages from your phone . Free mobile applications exist to stream sensor data from your phone. We recommend: . | Sensors2OCS (Android) allowing to stream all the sensors of your phone as OSC messages | Osc controller (Android) that proposes generic button and slider interfaces to send OSC messages | . To send OSC messages from your phone to your computer, you need to connect your phone and your computer to the same network. You can either use a local network (wifi) or a global network (internet). In both cases, you need to know the IP address of your computer. You can find it by typing ipconfig in the terminal (MacOS) or ipconfig in the command prompt (Windows), or in the network settings of your computer. Both application should be configurated with the IP address of your computer and the port number to send OSC messages to. The port number is a number between 0 and 65535. We recommend to use a number between 8000 and 9000. Receive OSC messages on your computer in Pure Data . Pure Data is a free and open-source visual programming language for creating interactive computer music and multimedia works. Pd enables musicians, visual artists, performers, researchers, and developers to create software graphically, without writing lines of code. Pd is used to process and generate sound, video, 2D/3D graphics, and interface sensors, input devices, and MIDI. Pd can easily run on micro-computers such as Raspberry Py and is hence a great tool for prototyping interactive systems. We recommend using the Plug Data version of Pd, as it provides a more user-friendly interface, and can be used as a standalone app or as a VST3, LV2, CLAP or AU plugin. You can download below a Pd patch we wrote to receive OSC messages from your phone. You can open it with Plug Data. 2a_phone_sensors.pd . Let’s go through the patch. The loadband object send a bang message (trigger signal) when the Pd patch is loaded. It is generally used to initialize settings. The listen 8000 object is a message triggered by the loadbang. It indicates that the program will listen for incoming OSC messages on port 8000. netreceive -u -b is configured to receive network messages using UDP protocol (-u for UDP and -b for binding to a port, which is set at 8000 from the previous object). Hence, the netreceive object will receive all raw messages, including those formatted in OSC, sent to port 8000. oscparse takes the raw OSC messages received from netreceive and parses them into a format that can be understood and used in Pd. Note that oscparse belongs to an external library named osc that you can install with the external manager named deken. The deken is a repository of all available external developed for Pd, and allow you to quickly install their last version from within Pd. You can access it from the menu Settings/Externals. Search for osc and install the library. At this stage, you should be able to receive OSC messages from your phone in Pd. You can also use the print object to display incomming messages in the console and check that you received the formatted OSC messages correctly. The rest is just a matter of extracting the information you need from the OSC messages: route the numerical values (arguments) from their address pattern, process, and scale the numerical values to fit your needs. The two applications might have a different OSC message format (might add a keyword in the address pattern, or send the values in a different order), so you might need to adapt the patch to your needs.

Let’s now build a sound synthesizer that we will control from the gestures. 2b_sound_synthesis.pd . Many techniques exist to synthesize sound. In this example, we will use substractive synthesis. The principle is to start from a complex sound (e.g., white noise) and remove some of its harmonics using a filter, in order to obtain a simpler sound. The noise~ object generates white noise. The ~ indicates that the object is a signal object (rather than a message), i.e., it processes audio signals. The vcf~ object is a voltage-controlled filter. It takes the white noise as input and two filter paramters: . | The cut-off frequency (in Hz) , which is the frequency above which the harmonics are removed. | The Q factor, which is the resonance of the filter. The higher the Q factor, the more the harmonics are removed. | . Both parameters are controled using horizontal sliders. Be sure to turn the volume of your computer down before playing with the sliders, as the sound can be very loud! . The output of the filter is sent to the dac~ object, which is the digital-to-analog converter that converts the digital signal into an analog signal that can be played by your speakers.

Pure Data allows you to create and manipulate audio systems using visual elements, rather than writing code. Think of it as building with virtual blocks – simply connect them together to design your unique audio setups. Plug Data . plugdata is a free/open-source visual programming environment based on pure-data. It is available for a wide range of operating systems, and can be used both as a standalone app, or as a VST3, LV2, CLAP or AU plugin. We recommend using Plug Data rather than Pure Data, as it provides a more user-friendly interface. SuperCollider . SuperCollider is a platform for audio synthesis and algorithmic composition, used by musicians, artists, and researchers working with sound.

Participants will explore the machine learning development cycle, engaging with interactive applications and Python programming. A practical project involves classifying museum artifacts using the MAMe dataset. | Sound: The second block centers on musical applications. Students will have to create a regression model from physical gestures to sound, employing the visual programming environment of Pure Data. Participants will learn Pure Data basics and discover how to transform their smartphones into synthesizers. Alternatively, students will tackle symbolic music generation using traditional programming (Python). | Text: Building on the first block, this third bloc explores embedding and navigating cultural archives with machine learning. Students will develop multi-modal models that link images to textual descriptions, aiming to provide innovative tools for exploring and retrieving artifacts in museum archives. | . ",
