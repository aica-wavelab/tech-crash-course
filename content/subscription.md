## 3. Sign up to the moodle platform

The moodle platform is open to both HM and HMTM students. It is **not** an administrative platform, but tool to exchange between students and teachers.
It is meant to gather all institutional emails, submit and collect assigments, and publish grades.

    <img src="{{ '/assets/images/logos/moodle_logo.png' | relative_url }}" alt="HM logo">
        <a href="https://moodle.hm.edu/course/view.php?id=21877" class="btn fs-5 mb-4 mb-md-0 mr-2" target="_blank">Sign up on Moodle</a>
  </div>

NB: You can subscribe with and without HM credentials. Just select *DFN-AAI/eduGAIN* if you are not an HM student.
