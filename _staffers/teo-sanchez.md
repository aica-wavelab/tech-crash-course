<!-- Téo Sanchez is a postdoctoral researcher at the MUC.DAI at Hochschule München, specializing in human-AI interaction. His research focuses on the understanding and development of teachable ML systems that enable users to simultaneously generate the knowledge data of interest and experience the model’s predictions and improvements. This approach creates simultaneous usage and development, promoting more personalized and transparent AI systems for non-experts, either for pedagogy or niche domains such as the arts.
He earned his Ph.D. as a member of the ExSitu research team at the LISN lab at Université Paris-Saclay and has actively used interactive ML in his teaching and science outreach activities in France.
