Benedikt is a software engineer, researcher, and lecturer whose research interests focus on the intersection between self-learning algorithms, society, and individuals. He currently serves as Head of Research at the Munich Center for Digital Sciences and AI (MUC.DAI) at Hochschule München University of Applied Sciences. Benedikt's academic background includes extensive experience in modeling and simulation of complex systems, particularly crowd dynamics.
Leveraging his expertise in complex systems, Benedikt is actively applying/extending a theoretical framework to understand the systemic relationships between self-learning algorithms, psychic systems (minds), and social systems. Additionally, as a contributing member of the AICA project, he engages with creative practices, bringing practical experience in symbolic music generation and creative coding.
