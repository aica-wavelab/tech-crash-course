## What is AICA? 

The Digitization College "Artificial Intelligence in Culture and Arts" (AICA) aims to equip students at the [University of Music and Performing Arts Munich](https://hmtm.de/) (HMTM) and [Hochschule MÃ¼nchen University of Applied Sciences](https://www.hm.edu/en/index.en.html) (HM) with necessary skills to impact AI innovations in the creative and cultural industries.

## What is the project workshop ?

The AICA Project Workshop will be hosted at the Wavelab, in the Summer Semester, **starting April 2024**.

This course is designed to enrich the skills of artists, designers, and computer scientists by delving into the intersection of machine learning with the creative and cultural sectors. The curriculum offers both theoretical and practical knowledge, catering to a diverse range of expertise.

The course is structured in three 2-day blocks and helps participants develop machine learning algorithms for image, sound, and text-based applications in the creative and cultural sectors.

## Course content

Structured over three 2-day blocks, the course addresses machine learning in the creative and cultural by increasing complexity and focusing on different data modalities:

1. **Images**: This introductory block focuses on image classification through machine learning. Participants will explore the machine learning development cycle, engaging with interactive applications and Python programming. A practical project involves classifying museum artifacts using the MAMe dataset.
2. **Sound**: The second block centers on musical applications. Students will have to create a regression model from physical gestures to sound, employing the visual programming environment of Pure Data. Participants will learn Pure Data basics and discover how to transform their smartphones into synthesizers. Alternatively, students will tackle symbolic music generation using traditional programming (Python).
3. **Text**: Building on the first block, this third bloc explores embedding and navigating cultural archives with machine learning. Students will develop multi-modal models that link images to textual descriptions, aiming to provide innovative tools for exploring and retrieving artifacts in museum archives.

## Pre-requisites

You do not need prior knowledge to follow this class. Fundamentals in imperative programming is a plus.

## Tutorials and teaching methods

This website provides a range of tutorials and ressources, organized by topic and in increasing order of difficulty.

[Tutorial overview](/docs/tutorials){: .btn target="_blank" target="_blank"}

A typical day of teaching starts with a lecture on a topic, followed by a hands-on session where students can apply the concepts learned in the lecture. The hands-on sessions are based on the tutorials provided on this website.

## Evaluation and ECTS

You will earn **2 ECTS** for the validation of the course.

The evaluation will be based on:
- Attendance: you must attend at least 4/6 days of teaching. Attending the first bloc is highly recommended.
- Completion of in-class practical work: you must provide the completed practical work by the end of the course. If you do not finish during the course, you will have to finish it at home.

## Credits and attributions

The tutorial are based on several **open-source tools and libraries** developed by talented researchers and developers. Without them, this course would not be possible.
